#  Automating CubeSat Mission Data Extraction and Analysis Using NLP

This project automates the extraction, structuring, and analysis of fragmented CubeSat mission data from web sources and documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The output is stored in a structured database and visualized through a web dashboard, simulating an end-to-end data engineering pipeline.

---

##  Objectives

- Extract unstructured CubeSat mission information (e.g., name, type, orbit, frequency band, technology)
- Preprocess, clean, and standardize this data using Python and NLP
- Store structured results in a relational PostgreSQL database (Supabase)
- Visualize mission insights and support future AI-based analysis
- Simulate Azure data engineering pipeline components
